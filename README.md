> **"Code freely, fix securely."**

## 🚀 What is Project VaaS?

**Project VaaS (Vulnerability as a Service)** is an AI-powered security platform that works with developers to detect, explain, and fix code vulnerabilities — without slowing down your flow.  

VaaS uses a **team of AI agents** — the Hunter, the Explainer, and the Fixer — who collaborate with you in real time to keep your codebase secure.

---

## 🎯 Core Features

✅ **Automatic Scanning:** Detect insecure code patterns and misconfigurations with Semgrep/Trivy.  
✅ **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Specialized AI agents find, explain, and fix issues collectively.  
✅ **Clear Explanations:** Understand risks with real-world exploit scenarios.  
✅ **Auto-Generated Fixes:** Accept safe, AI-suggested patches or modify them to match your style.  
✅ **GitHub Integration:** Scan PRs, create secure PRs, verify fixes automatically.  
✅ **Developer-First:** Learn secure coding patterns passively as you work.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project-vaas.git
cd project-vaas
````

### 2️⃣ Set up Python backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Install Semgrep locally

```bash
brew install semgrep    # Mac
# OR
pip install semgrep
```

### 4️⃣ Run your first scan

```bash
semgrep --config=p/ci --json --output=output.json .
```

### 5️⃣ Launch backend API

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 6️⃣ Start frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🤖 How it Works

1. **Hunter** scans your code for vulnerabilities.
2. **Explainer** summarizes the risks & impact.
3. **Fixer** generates safe patch suggestions.
4. **You** review, approve, and merge fixes with full context.

---

## 💡 Roadmap

* ✅ Basic scan & report
* ✅ Multi-agent orchestration with AutoGen or CrewAI
* ✅ Chat UI for agent-user interaction
* ⏳ GitHub PR automation
* ⏳ Multi-language support (Node, Python, Java)
* ⏳ Developer security score dashboard

## ✅ **📦 Starter Pack**

Create these files as a minimum:

```
project-vaas/
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py          # FastAPI entry point
│   ├── agents.py        # Define Hunter, Explainer, Fixer with CrewAI or AutoGen
│   ├── scanner.py       # Semgrep wrapper
│   ├── requirements.txt # FastAPI, pydantic, semgrep, autogen/crewAI, openai
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/

### 📌 Next Step

If you want, I can generate:
✅ `main.py` (FastAPI)
✅ `agents.py` starter with CrewAI agent structure
✅ `scanner.py` example for Semgrep JSON parsing
✅ `App.jsx` with a simple chat box.

**Say “yes”** and I’ll prepare this starter code for you right now — so you can push your **Project VaaS** repo today! 🚀
